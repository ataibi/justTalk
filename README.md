## Just Talk
#### _A simple messaging app made using  [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)_

The basic concept of this messaging app (at the moment) is to **just talk**, meaning you don't create an account, you don't have contacts, there is no message database.
___
### **How does this work then ?**

You choose a username and a three digits tag is assigned to you. Anyone who wants to talk to you will need your username and those three digits. (I wanted three digits so someone can have username_666)
Once you are set up, enter the username and tag of the person you want to talk to and _just talk_.

 **No traces left behind.**
 Once you close the app, you cannot recover your messages, they were never saved anywhere.
 You can also choose to reset your tag and username every time you start the app or keep them saved locally (it will be save by default to avoid the struggle of giving it to your friends again and again).

## Installation

Well for the moment there are no builds of the app since it does nothing but you can...

## Run it from source !
You will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) for that.
Once you have it installed, clone the repository and start the app !
```bash
user@superLinux ~ $ git clone https://github.com/ataibi/justTalk.git justTalk
user@superLinux ~ $ cd justTalk
user@superLinux ~/justTalk $ npm install #install dependencies
user@superLinux ~/justTalk $ npm start
```
And _voilà_ !

This is my first electron project so comments and contributions are welcome. I will soon make a contribution guideline, but for the moment you are welcome to report any issue you find (as of now, the first, _and hopefully only_, issue you might find is that the app doesn't really do anything)
